What is Tasker?
------------

Tasker is a powerful automation engine for Android. It's an app that lets you
configure triggers based on key events, to perform a series of actions. 

For example, you can make your phone go into "Work" mode by disabling silent 
mode once it detects your work WiFi, or perhaps have it play music 
automatically once you've plugged in your earphones.
